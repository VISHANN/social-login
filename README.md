Developers take note, you would have to supply your own credentials in .env file as follows:
  BASE_URL=http://localhost:<YOUR PORT NUMBER>
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR GOOGLE CLIENT ID HERE>
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR GOOGLE CLIENT SECRET>

Also that we ARE NOT using the custom findOrCreate function
